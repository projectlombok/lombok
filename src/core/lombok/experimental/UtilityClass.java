 * An annotation to create utility classes.
 * 
 * If a class is annotated with {@code @UtilityClass}, the following things happen to it:<ul>
 * <li>It is marked final.</li>
 * <li>If any constructors are declared in it, an error is generated. Otherwise, a private no-args constructor is generated; it throws a {@code AssertionError}.</li>
 * <li>All methods, inner classes, and fields in the class are marked static.</li>
 * <li><em>WARNING:</em> Do not use non-star static imports to import these members; javac won't be able to figure it out. Use either:
 *    {@code import static ThisType.*;} or don't static-import.</li>
