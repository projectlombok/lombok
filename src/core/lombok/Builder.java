/**
 * The builder annotation creates a so-called 'builder' aspect to the class that is annotated or the class
 * that contains a member which is annotated with {@code @Builder}.
 * <p>
 * If a member is annotated, it must be either a constructor or a method. If a class is annotated,
 * then a package-private constructor is generated with all fields as arguments
 * (as if {@code @AllArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PACKAGE)} is present
 * on the class), and it is as if this constructor has been annotated with {@code @Builder} instead.
 * Note that this constructor is only generated if you haven't written any constructors and also haven't
 * added any explicit {@code @XArgsConstructor} annotations. In those cases, lombok will assume an all-args
 * constructor is present and generate code that uses it; this means you'd get a compiler error if this
 * constructor is not present.
 * <p>
 * The effect of {@code @Builder} is that an inner class is generated named <code><strong>T</strong>Builder</code>,
 * with a private constructor. Instances of <code><strong>T</strong>Builder</code> are made with the
 * method named {@code builder()} which is also generated for you in the class itself (not in the builder class).
 * <p>
 * The <code><strong>T</strong>Builder</code> class contains 1 method for each parameter of the annotated
 * constructor / method (each field, when annotating a class), which returns the builder itself.
 * The builder also has a {@code build()} method which returns a completed instance of the original type,
 * created by passing all parameters as set via the various other methods in the builder to the constructor
 * or method that was annotated with {@code @Builder}. The return type of this method will be the same
 * as the relevant class, unless a method has been annotated, in which case it'll be equal to the
 * return type of that method.
 * <p>
 * Complete documentation is found at <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder">the project lombok features page for &#64;Builder</a>.
