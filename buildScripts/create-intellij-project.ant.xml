	<description>
This buildfile is part of projectlombok.org. It creates the infrastructure needed to develop lombok on intellij.
	</description>
	
	<target name="intellij" depends="create.spiProcessor, deps" description="Creates intellij project files and downloads all dependencies. Open this directory as a project in IntelliJ after running this target">
		<echo> ** WARNING ** The core lombok contributors all use eclipse to develop lombok. This script will attempt to set up your lombok directory up as intellij project; whether can be used in a modern intellij is currently unknown. Please do continue, but be aware that trying to work on lombok from intellij may run into problems. If you want to adopt 'work on lombok via intellij' as a task, we're open to it!</echo>
		<echo>NOT IMPLEMENTED: The project should optimally be configured as a java1.6, using the rt.jar in lib/openjdk6_rt.jar as boot basis, to ensure lombok remains 1.6 compatible.</echo>
		<echo>NOT IMPLEMENTED: Ability to run tests targeted at a specific jvm/javac/ecj/eclipse release; the relevant entrypoint test classes are lombok.RunBaseAndJavacTests and lombok.RunEclipseTests - you can run the eclipse tests even on intellij; an eclipse installation is not required.</echo>
		<echo>NOT SURE: The annotation processor system that automatically generates the services files has been changed. This AP is now internal to the project, 
		the source files for it are in `src/spiProcessor`, and a build of this is now in `dist/spiProcessor.jar` - you may have to manually add it, though I'm not
		sure if you actually need it - the files generated by this processor are relevant only when running lombok itself, and if intellij accomplishes this by
		invoking ant, all will be well.</echo>
