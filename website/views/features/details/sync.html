        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            <code>@Synchronized</code> is a safer variant of the <code>synchronized</code> method modifier. Like <code>synchronized</code>,
            the
            annotation can be used on static and instance methods only. It operates similarly to the
            <code>synchronized</code> keyword, but it locks
            on different objects. The keyword locks on <code>this</code>, but the annotation locks on a field named
            <code>$lock</code>, which is private.<br/>
            If the field does not exist, it is created for you. If you annotate a <code>static</code> method, the
            annotation locks on a static field
            named <code>$LOCK</code> instead.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want, you can create these locks yourself. The <code>$lock</code> and <code>$LOCK</code> fields will
            of course not be generated if you
            already created them yourself. You can also choose to lock on another field, by specifying it as parameter
            to the <code>@Synchronized</code>
            annotation. In this usage variant, the fields will not be created automatically, and you must explicitly
            create them yourself, or an error will be emitted.
        </p>

        <p>
            Locking on <code>this</code> or your own class object can have unfortunate side-effects, as other code not
            under your control can lock on these
            objects as well, which can cause race conditions and other nasty threading-related bugs.

            <p>
                If <code>$lock</code> and/or <code>$LOCK</code> are auto-generated, the fields are initialized with an
                empty <code>Object[]</code> array, and not
                just a <code>new Object()</code> as most snippets showing this pattern in action use. Lombok does this
                because a new object is <em>NOT</em>
                serializable, but 0-size array is. Therefore, using <code>@Synchronized</code> will not prevent your
                object from being serialized.
            </p>

            <p>
                Having at least one <code>@Synchronized</code> method in your class means there will be a lock field,
                but if you later remove all such methods,
                there will no longer be a lock field. That means your predetermined <code>serialVersionUID</code>
                changes. We suggest you <em>always</em> add
                a <code>serialVersionUID</code> to your classes if you intend to store them long-term via java's
                serialization mechanism. If you do so, removing
                all <code>@Synchronized</code> annotations from your method will not break serialization.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you'd like to know why a field is not automatically generated when you choose your own name for the
                lock object: Because otherwise making a typo
                in the field name will result in a <em>very</em> hard to find bug!
