        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            <code>@SneakyThrows</code> can be used to sneakily throw checked exceptions without actually declaring
            this in your method's <code>throws</code>
            clause. This somewhat contentious ability should be used carefully, of course. The code generated by
            lombok will not ignore, wrap, replace,
            or otherwise modify the thrown checked exception; it simply fakes out the compiler. On the JVM (class
            file) level, all exceptions, checked or not,
            can be thrown regardless of the <code>throws</code> clause of your methods, which is why this works.
        </p>

        <p>
            Common use cases for when you want to opt out of the checked exception mechanism center around 2
            situations:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>A needlessly strict interface, such as <code>Runnable</code> - whatever exception propagates out of
                your <code>run()</code> method,
                checked or not, it will be passed to the <code>Thread</code>'s unhandled exception handler. Catching
                a checked exception and wrapping it
                in some sort of <code>RuntimeException</code> is only obscuring the real cause of the issue.
            </li>
            <li>An 'impossible' exception. For example, <code>new String(someByteArray, "UTF-8");</code> declares
                that it can throw an
                <code>UnsupportedEncodingException</code> but according to the JVM specification, UTF-8
                <em>must</em> always be available. An
                <code>UnsupportedEncodingException</code> here is about as likely as a
                <code>ClassNotFoundError</code> when you use a String object,
                and you don't catch those either!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Be aware that it is <em>impossible</em> to catch sneakily thrown checked types directly, as javac will not
            let you write a catch block
            for an exception type that no method call in the try body declares as thrown. This problem is not relevant
            in either of the use cases listed
            above, so let this serve as a warning that you should not use the <code>@SneakyThrows</code> mechanism
            without some deliberation!
        </p>

        <p>
            You can pass any number of exceptions to the <code>@SneakyThrows</code> annotation. If you pass no
            exceptions, you may throw any
            exception sneakily.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>NOTE: </em> with lombok versions older than 0.10, unlike other lombok transformations, you need to
            put <strong>lombok.jar</strong> on your
            classpath when you run your program.

                Because <code>@SneakyThrows</code> is an implementation detail and not part of your method
                signature, it is an error if you try to
                declare a checked exception as sneakily thrown when you don't call any methods that throw this
                exception. (Doing so is perfectly legal
                for <code>throws</code> statements to accommodate subclasses). Similarly, <code>@SneakyThrows</code>
                does not inherit.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the nay-sayers in the crowd: Out of the box, Eclipse will offer a 'quick-fix' for uncaught
                exceptions that wraps the offending
                statement in a try/catch block with just <code>e.printStackTrace()</code> in the catch block. This
                is so spectacularly non-productive
                compared to just sneakily throwing the exception onwards, that Roel and Reinier feel more than
                justified in claiming that the
                checked exception system is far from perfect, and thus an opt-out mechanism is warranted.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you put <code>@SneakyThrows</code> on a constructor, any call to a sibling or super constructor
                is <em>excluded</em> from the <code>@SneakyThrows</code> treatment. This is a
                java restriction we cannot work around: Calls to sibling/super constructors MUST be the first
                statement in the constructor; they cannot be placed inside try/catch blocks.
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>@SneakyThrows</code> on an empty method, or a constructor that is empty or only has a call to
                a sibling / super constructor results in no try/catch block and a warning.
