			The <a href="/api/">Lombok javadoc</a> is available, but we advise these pages.

			<p>
				Experimental features are available in your normal lombok installation, but are not as robustly supported as lombok's main features. In particular, experimental features:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Are not tested as well as the core features.
					</li><li>
						Do not get bugs fixed as quickly as core features.
					</li><li>
						May have APIs that will change, possibly drastically if we find a different, better way to solve the same problem.
					</li><li>
						May disappear entirely if the feature is too difficult to support or doesn't bust enough boilerplate.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p><p>
				Features that receive positive community feedback and which seem to produce clean, flexible code will eventually become accepted as a core feature and move out of the experimental package.
